# Express Todo

The classic todo app in API form.

#### Install:

To run this project on your local server, first install the dependencies with the command:

```
npm install
```

Next you will need to create a ".env" file at the root of the project. You will now need to create a database on MongoDB Atlas. Inside the ".env" file replace the end string with your database's connection string.

```
MONGODB_URI="ADDYOURMONGODBCONNECTIONSTRING"
```

After that is done, you can start the server with:

```
npm run dev
```
